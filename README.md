## DRROut-paint: GAN based GenAI algorithm to out paint and generate images with large field of view from small field of view

### A generative AI, based upon pix2pix GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model, that gets small filed of view (FOV) X-ray scans and generates Large field of view X-ray images, out-painted by using prior information of patient body.

#### Network Inputs
